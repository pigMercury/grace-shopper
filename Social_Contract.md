Social Contract

Each group should discuss and provide an answer for the following questions

What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)?
  If necessary, involve other team members
  Explain pros/cons of each stance, temperature check, discuss further if necessary
  Get a fellow’s/instructor’s input
  Vote as a last resort

What does this group do when a member is frustrated?
  The frustrated person should first try to step back and switch tasks, get a drink, take a walk, meditate, etc.
  The frustrated person needs to precisely communicate what is frustrating them with other group member(s)
  Bring up serious issues with the group. Temperature check: if you feel compelled to talk negatively about a group member with someone else, you need to talk to them about it
What do you do if you're the person someone is frustrated with? 
  Check in with the frustrated person if everything’s ok
  Discuss what they are frustrated with and ask if there’s anything we could do differently
Imagine a situation where Person A thinks that Person B is not pulling their weight - write a script for how you think that conversation should go.
  Check in with Person B if they have any blockers that are slowing them down
  Communicate if you have any external issues affecting their work

What does this group do when we merge our work together?
  Play “Come Together” by The Beatles
  Create new branch locally, commit to new branch, push to github, make a pull request on github, someone else approves it (DM if you need a specific person), if ok merge promptly, otherwise comment, delete branch once merged
  -> git checkout -b <branchName>-#<issueNumber>	 // new branch
     *issueNumber as assigned by waffle/github

When does this group ask for help?
  Put in a sincere effort, but if you are dead-ending for more than 15 minutes seek help from the other pair.  Same when working with the other pair, bring in a fellow if you continue dead-ending
  If you suspect a higher level issue but are unsure, jot down the time and issue (bug log) and the feeling persists for ~a half hour, seek out help as above
What strategies do we use before we ask for help?
  console.log
  dev tools
  documentation
  Google error messages
  explain the code aloud

How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other?
  Decide on a daily basis whether we want to pair for the day or switch up w/i the day
Do members of a pair decide their own norms or does the group have one set of norms for everything? If the latter, what are they? 
  Generally trade-off at natural breaks, at natural commit points

How does this group approach work "after hours" (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)?
  Occasionally, no obligation. If you do choose to work just be sure to communicate what you do.
  Determine Friday if we need to work over the weekend in order to make the Wednesday deadline

What time does this group have daily stand up?
  10:30/10:35

Other Stuff:
Waffle inbox issues only for code stuff or for any to-do-list item?
  Don't know convention, but we'll use it for everything
